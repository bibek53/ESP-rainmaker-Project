rainmaker project using ac dimmer  and relay with manual switch

In my project, I utilized Rainmaker to write the code and created an innovative home automation system. The main focus was on controlling the speed of an AC fan using an AC dimmer. Additionally, I incorporated a manual switch to ensure functionality even when internet connectivity is unavailable, allowing users to manually turn on and off the fan and lights.
